# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task

As you proceed in your journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework has taught you all the skills you need to succeed in this challenge.
